Use Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio or Eclipse to Run the Quickstarts
============================================================

You can also deploy the quickstarts or run the Arquillian tests from Eclipse using JBoss tools. 

For information on how to configure Maven and Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio for use with the quickstarts, see the [Getting Started Guide](https://access.redhat.com/site/documentation/en-US/JBoss_Enterprise_Application_Platform/6.3/html-single/Getting_Started_Guide/index.html "Getting Started Guide") for Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform. 

See [Get Started](http://www.jboss.org/get-started/ "Get Started") on the JBoss Developer web site for additional information.

_Note:_ If the quickstart project uses JPA to access a database, you will see the following warning when you import the project into Eclipse. You can ignore this warning as it only applies to the local connection in the Eclipse development environment and does not affect the JBoss EAP runtime deployment. To eliminate this warning, you must configure the database connection in the Eclipse project settings. 
 
         JPA Problem: No connection specified for project. No database-specific validation will be performed.
